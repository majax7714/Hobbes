# lattice — the Calvin experiments' E0 instruments

Bench tooling for `docs/calvin/calvin-experiments.md` (ADR-151): sqlite-vector's SIMD kernel lattice,
the holes punched in it, and the graders a model's body goes through. Never product, never versioned.

```sh
cd bench/calvin/lattice && uv sync && uv run pytest
```

The real-source fixture is `tests/fixtures/sqlite-vector-kernels/` (`PROVENANCE.md`). The target itself is
a checkout outside this repo. Anything that runs its code runs in the sandbox image.
